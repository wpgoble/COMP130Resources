# below we have two examples for how we can print to the screen
print("Hello World")    # Here our string uses double quotes
print('Go Birds')       # Here our string uses single quotes

# Below we will ask the user for their favorite color and
# store it in the variable favoriteColor. Then we can print
# the variable favoriteColor to the screen.
