1. For vs While Loop
    For loop is used when we want to iterate a fixed number of times.
    A while loop is used when we have an arbitrary number of iterations
    to make.

2. with import math, you need to use dot notation to specify the math
    functions we want to use, with from math import *, we can just
    use the function name

3. No. When using sequentail if states, each if statement will be checked,
    but with if-elif-else blocks, the conditions will only be checked until
    one returns true.

6. Dictionaries use key-value pairs,
    Both are methods for storing large amounts of info. Lists use
    integers as the "key" in the key-value pair, while with a dict
    we can set the key to be whatever we want (within reason)

7. For code block A: we use the length of foo to iterate over the
    index of the list
    For code block B: we just access the elements directly
